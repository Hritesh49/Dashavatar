                    <p>
                        The ninth avatar of Lord Vishnu, Gautama Buddha. The Buddha has
                        been a formative force in the origins of Hinduism. According to
                        the Agni Purana, Vishnu assumed this incarnation on earth due to
                        the daityas defeating the devas in their battles. In order to
                        restore the natural order, he deluded the asuras with his
                        teachings. This caused them to abandon the path established by the
                        Vedas and convert to Buddhism, causing them to be devoid of
                        dharma.

                        (Period) to remove adharma and ushers in the Satya Yuga, while

                        of time. He is described as a Brahmin warrior in the Puranas.
